These are all submitted projects for CSC 501, Operating System.

In these pojects, PA0 and PA1 are totally completed and right.

PA2 is about memory management and it is very complicated and hard, a lot of knowledges, data structures are used and many documents are needed for PA2. It is not right completely. Actually I know how the paging management system works later, but I have to reconstruct the whole project and many data structures, at that time I don't have enought time for it, so I gave up. And there are some bugs in it now.

PA3 is easy if you know how rw-locks work. I used a complicated method to implement it. However, it is more convenient to use queue q[] that XINO offers by itself.

For PA2 and PA3, official testcases are in sys directory.
